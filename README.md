# VecMath 📐

## Overview
VecMath is a lightweight, high-performance header-only C++ library designed for 2D vector operations. Developed with a focus on developer ergonomics and efficiency, it provides a clean interface for common geometric computations essential in game development, physics engines, and graphics programming. 🚀

## Features
*   ✨ **Header-Only Integration**: Simply include `vec2.hpp` and you are ready to go—no complex linking required.
*   ⚡ **Modern C++ Semantics**: Implements move semantics and copy assignment to ensure optimal memory management.
*   🎯 **Mathematical Precision**: Built-in support for normalization, dot product calculation, and vector scaling.
*   🛠️ **Operator Overloading**: Intuitive syntax for vector addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   📏 **Geometric Utilities**: Easily calculate vector magnitude (length) and equality checks.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

*   **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/coolerputt01/VecMath
    ```
*   **Navigate to the Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd VecMath
    ```
*   **Build the Project**:
    Ensure you have `g++` installed. Run the following command to compile the example:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -Isrc -o builds/main
    ```
*   **Run the Executable**:
    ```bash
    ./builds/main
    ```

## Usage

Integrating VecMath into your project is straightforward. Below is a practical example of how to perform vector transformations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "vec2.hpp"

int main() {
    // Initialize vectors
    Vector2 position(10, 15);
    Vector2 velocity(2, 3);

    // Perform vector addition using overloaded operators
    position += velocity;

    // Scale the vector
    position.scale(2);

    // Normalize and get length
    float length = position.getLength();
    Vector2 direction = position.normalized();

    std::cout << "Magnitude: " << length << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
